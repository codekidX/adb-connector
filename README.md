ADB Connector
===================


Just hacked out a tool to easily connect to a adb device (ADB over Network enabled). Written in java so its cross-platform and since you might be developing for android you will have java.

### How to use

- Download [ADB.Connector.jar](https://github.com/codekidX/adb-connector/releases/download/0.0.1/ADB.Connector.jar)
- Open it.
- Enter END IP _(The connector detects your IP address but you need to add device address. Example: 192.168.0.101:5555 is what its showing on your device. Here, END IP is **101** )_
- Click connect.
